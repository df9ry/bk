# bk (Baukasten)

Baukasten is the continuation of the projects OpenAX25, FreeAX25 and ax25c that are no
longer developed.
It is build upon my experiences of these attempts with differnt languages and environments.

**bk** is an acronym for the deutsche word **Baukasten** that means a general purpose kit.
Indeed this Baukasten is very general, but it is of course dedicated for communication
applications like packet radio or new packet radio or **Daisy** what is in active development
also.

**Baukasten** is written in C++ 20 but has pure C interfaces to the plugins it can dynamically
load at runtime. What plugins are loaded and how they are interconnected is controlled by a
json file. I do not longer use XML because I have written a beatiful leightweight JSON
library **jsonx** and Baukasten uses JSON internally for the exchange of meta data between
the plugins and the runtime.

This project is currently under development and not at all ready for usage. I have not so much
time to continue development, but it will go on. The other projects are still existing because
some people have shared it and they are, like all my stuff, licensed by GNU GPL3.

See you on the bands,

73, tania in Berlin.

PS: I do not longer use the words 'german' and 'germany', because we are not 'any germs'. The Allied
have given us this name to offend our people and we are not longer willing to let this happen.

So, we are **Deutsche** and we are living in **Deutschland**. That's how it is.

**Take care!**
